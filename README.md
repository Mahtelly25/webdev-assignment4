Chemistry: Elements & Compounds
This is a responsive multi-section webpage built to demonstrate modern CSS layout techniques, specifically Flexbox and CSS Grid. The content focuses on fundamental chemistry concepts, providing an educational overview of matter, elements, and compounds.

Project Objective
The goal of this project was to create a single-page website that adapts gracefully to various screen sizes. It showcases the following skills:

Flexbox: Used for one-dimensional layouts, specifically for the horizontal alignment and spacing of the navigation bar links.

CSS Grid: Utilized for a two-dimensional layout, creating the main content and sidebar structure.

Responsive Web Design (RWD): The layout adjusts to mobile, tablet, and desktop views using media queries and relative units.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the semantic structure of the webpage.

CSS3: For all styling and layout, including a dark theme. No external frameworks or libraries were used.

How to View
To view the project, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The responsive design can be tested by resizing the browser window or by using your browser's developer tools to simulate different device screen sizes.

File Structure
index.html: Contains the core HTML structure and content.

style.css: Contains all the CSS rules for styling, layout, and responsiveness.
