            <h2>The Foundation of Matter</h2>
            <p>
                Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules, and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior, and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.

            <h3 id="periodic-table">The Periodic Table of Elements</h3>
            <p>
                The periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements, which are arranged by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. The structure of the table shows periodic trends. The seven rows of the table, called periods, generally have metals on the left and nonmetals on the right. The columns, called groups, contain elements with similar chemical behaviors.
            </p>

            <h3 id="chemical-bonds">Chemical Bonds</h3>
            <p>
                A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms, ions or molecules that enables the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between opposite charges, as in ionic bonds, or through the sharing of electrons, as in covalent bonds.
            </p>

            <h3 id="acid-base">Acids and Bases</h3>
            <p>
                In chemistry, an acid is a substance that donates protons (hydrogen ions) or accepts a pair of valence electrons to form a bond. A base is a substance that accepts protons or donates a pair of valence electrons. The pH scale is used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution, with lower pH values indicating a higher concentration of hydrogen ions and thus more acidity.
            </p>
            
            <h3 id="molecules">What is a Molecule?</h3>
            <p>
                A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. They can be homogeneous, consisting of atoms of a single chemical element, or heterogeneous, composed of atoms of more than one element.
